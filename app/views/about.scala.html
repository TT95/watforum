      <h3 class="separate">Why was SWT program made in first place?</h3>
      <p class="separate">
        Let's cover some basics to understand the problem.
        The SWT program is a part of Stateâ€™s
        Exchange Visitor Program, which was established to implement the purposes of
        the Fulbright-Hays Act which are:

      <p class="quote">
          "Strengthening ties and increasing mutual understanding between
          the people of the United States
          and the people of other countries."
      </p>

      <h3 class="separate">Did you know that this program is under a serious treat?</h3>

        (full article here). Help by supporting projects such as this one,

         - Have you ever wondered why are some people denied Visa?
      </p>

      <p>
        There is cap set from the government!

          (76 Federal Register Nov.7,2011)</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        - Why did goverment set a cap?
      </p>

      <p>
        It would be best to qoute U.S. GAO <a href="http://www.gao.gov/assets/670/668453.pdf">paper</a>:
      </p>
      <p class="quote">
          "State acknowledged an increase in SWT-related
          complaints regarding, for example, <b>improper or unsafe job placements,
          fraudulent job offers, post-arrival job cancellations, inappropriate work
            hours, and problems regarding housing and transportation.</b> <br>
          State capped at 2011 levels the participants allotted to each sponsor, effectively
          <b>restricting the total number of participants to 109,000.</b>"
      </p>

      <p>
        According to the 2012 IFR, the restriction on
        program size would remain until State was confident that the program
        regulations were sufficient to remedy identified concerns and as years passed by, State had no  current plans for lifting the
        program cap
      </p>

      <h3 class="separate">How are we trying to solve this problem?</h3>

      <ul class="separate">
        <li>non-profit organization </li>
        <li>creating big community which can make a difference</li>
        <li>database of verified places for work and housing available to everyone</li>
        <li>possible oversight which could further protect the health, safety and welfare of exchange visitors</li>
        <li>helping both studens and sponsors, willing to cooperate for benefith of outgoing students</li>
        <li>making USA summer employers happy - providing them students</li>
        <li>completely transparent </li>
