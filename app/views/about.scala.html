      <p class="separate">
        Let's cover some basics first.
        The SWT program is a part of State’s
        Exchange Visitor Program, which was established to implement the purposes of
        the Fulbright-Hays Act which are:

          "Strengthening ties and increasing mutual understanding between
          the people of the United States
          and the people of other countries."

      <p class="small-separate">
         Have you ever wondered why is SWT Visa request denied for a lot of people?
      </p>

      <p>
        There is cap set from the United States government
        <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-11-07/html/2011-28810.htm]">
          (76 Federal Register Nov.7,2011)</a>
          It would be best to qoute U.S. GAO <a href="http://www.gao.gov/assets/670/668453.pdf">paper</a>:

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-9">
          <p class="quote">
            "State acknowledged an increase in SWT-related
            complaints regarding, for example, improper or unsafe job placements,
            fraudulent job offers, post-arrival job cancellations, inappropriate work
            hours, and problems regarding housing and transportation.
            State capped at 2011 levels the participants allotted to each sponsor, effectively
            <b>restricting the total number of participants to 109,000.</b>"

        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="small-separate">
        According to the IFR, the restriction on
        program size would remain until State was confident that the program
        regulations were sufficient to remedy identified concerns and as years passed by, State has no  current plans for lifting the
        program cap
      </p>

      <h3 class="separate">How are we trying to solve this problem?</h3>

      <ul class="separate wat-solutions">
        <li class="solution-item">creating big community which can make a difference</li>
        <li class="solution-item">database of verified places for work and housing available to everyone</li>
        <li class="solution-item">possible oversight which could further protect the health, safety and welfare of exchange visitors</li>
